        <h1>welcome to the internet's bare-bones spectacular!</h1>
<p>and it's absolutely bananas! üçå</p>
<p>hang on, what more did you expect? a juggling monkey? üêí</p>
<p>you're probably one of those folks who make websites and think they're the next sliced bread. bet you dream of that glittery awwward sticker on your site like a kid dreams of a gold star in kindergarten. you reckon your monstrous jquery file is the life of the party, making ie7 dance like it's 1999. oh, sweet summer child...</p>

<h2>here's what a fab website really looks like:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>light as a feather - not like aunt patty after her third serving of thanksgiving turkey.</li>
    <li>fits everywhere - from your fancy iphone to your grandma's ancient nokia.</li>
    <li>consistent look - unlike your hair on a humid day.</li>
    <li>welcomes everyone - yes, even that cousin who wears socks with sandals.</li>
    <li>clear message - not a cryptic treasure map to the hipster caf√© down the lane.</li>
</ul>

<p>now, let's get real:</p>
<p>why the heck are you making a banner do the cha-cha when someone hovers? spent a weekend on it, added the weight of a small elephant to your site, and guess what? no one's even going to notice, especially not with those sausage fingers on their tablet. and let's not forget our visually impaired pals, who'll miss out on your "glorious" creation.</p>

<h2>this right here? it's the ultimate website. here's the lowdown:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>featherweight champion - this whole page is lighter than your cat's sneeze. and you, my friend, loaded a ton just to have a fancy 'hello' on your homepage? come on!</li>
    <li>one size fits all - who said you need fancy pants codes to fit everywhere? this site's more adaptable than a chameleon in a box of crayons.</li>
    <li>it just works - it's like reading a book, if you remember what those are. clean, neat, and no-nonsense. the kind of simplicity even your grandma approves of.</li>
    <li>actual content - not just a name and a link to that one embarrassing photo of you from 2009. and no need to chase a bouncing button just to see it all.</li>
</ul>

<p>try this on ie6. it's like feeding a t-rex a salad. ü¶ñ</p>

<p>seriously, when was the last time you saw a pure, unadulterated website? if you've never seen a bearded man shave, you're missing out. just like you're missing out on what websites used to be. this, my friend, is a website in its birthday suit. and it's a thing of beauty.</p>

<h2>yeah, yeah, this is all for giggles.</h2>
<p>i'm not saying your website should be this bare-bones (though, think of the speed!). but remember, sometimes less is more. you're the one complicating things. websites are simple creatures; don't make them into overburdened mules.</p>
